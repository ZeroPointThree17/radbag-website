        <h2>RadBag Wallet Privacy Policy</h2>
    </div>

    <p>RadBag Labs built the RadBag Wallet app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by RadBag Labs at no cost
        and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
        Information if anyone decided to use our Service.


    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

    <p>While using our Service, we will NOT require you to provide us with any personally identifiable information.</p>


    <h3>Why we ask for Location permission</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>In order to connect any hardware wallet via a Bluetooth connection, we need to enable Bluetooth and
            Location
            permission on Android</li>

        <li>We are using Location permission on Android to send Bluetooth Low Energy messages between the app and the
            hardware
            wallet. We will NOT use or share your location at any time.</li>

        <li>Location permission on Android is requested for any hardware wallet regardless of whether it allows
            bluetooth
            connections or not. This is because the scanning mechanism cannot determine ahead of time if the hardware
            wallet
            does
            not support bluetooth.</li>

        <li>If you do not use a hardware wallet, Location permission is never requested.</li>

        <li>The iOS version of the app never requests Location permissions.</li>
    </ul>
